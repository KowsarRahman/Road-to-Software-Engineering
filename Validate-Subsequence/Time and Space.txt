The space complexity of this code is O(1) as it uses only a few variables to keep track of the indices and no additional data structures are used. The variables seqIndx, arrIndx are consuming constant space.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The reason for this is that the while loop iterates through both the array and the sequence simultaneously, and each element of the array is visited only once. Thus, the total number of operations performed is proportional to the length of the array.

It is also worth noting that the sequence array is not taken into account in the time complexity analysis. As it is compared element by element with the array on every iteration of the loop, so the time complexity would be the same if the sequence array was replaced by any other data structure of similar size.
